# Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL

In this project, we'll work with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like the following:

- population — the global population. <br>
- population_growth — the annual population growth rate, as a percentage. <br>
- area — the total land and water area.

In this guided project, we'll use SQL in Jupyter Notebook to analyze data from this database. If you want to work on this project locally, you can download the [SQLite factbook.db database](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/257/factbook.db) by clicking the Download button on the right.
